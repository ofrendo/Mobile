# API Calls
These are the API calls that can be made to the backend.

## Session management
#### Login
```
POST /auth/login

Required: 
username
password

Returns:
user_id
email
phone
username
name


//Sample usage:
$.ajax({
	type: "POST",
	url: "/auth/login",
	data: {
		username: sampleUser.username,
		password: sampleUser.password
	},
	success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
		//On login: data.user_id
	},
	error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
		//On error, for example wrong password
	}
});
```

`data` in `success` returns a user JSON object like in `user/:user_id`.

Status codes:
- 200: OK
- 400: Error during login

#### Logout
```
POST /auth/logout
```

Status codes:
- 200: Successful logout

## Unit testing
Open `/test` in a browser.

## User
#### Creating a user
```
POST /user

Required: 
user.email
user.username
user.password
user.name

Optional:
user.phone

Returns:
user_id

//Sample usage:
var sampleUser = {
	email: "hello@wor.ld",
	username: "helloWorld",
	password: "helloPass",
	name: "Hello World"
};
$.ajax({
	type: "POST",
	url: "/user",
	data: {user: sampleUser},
	success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
		sampleUser.user_id = data.user_id;

## WebSocket chat
The library `socket.io` is used for the WebSocket connection. The chat is room based, which means each trip has its own room. A user can only join one room at a time. In order to connect:
```
//Can also use http://localhost:5000 if using the local server
var url = "https://thawing-stream-4939.herokuapp.com:443"; 
var socket = io.connect(url);
```


#### Message structure
Each message has the following structure:
```
message.user_id
message.username
message.name
message.trip_id
message.msg_id
message.msg_text
message.created_on
```



#### Emitting events
These are the events that the client can emit to the server.
```
//Call this to join a room for a given trip_id
//The response is room.previousMessages
socket.emit("room.join", {trip_id: trip.trip_id});


//Call this to leave the current room
//The response is room.left
socket.emit("room.leave");


//Call this to send a message to other participants
//The response is msg.sent
socket.emit("msg.send", {msg_text: text});
```



#### Reacting to events
These are the events that the server will emit to the client. 

```
//This event will be emitted upon connecting (not joining a room)
socket.on("connect", function() {
	
});

//This event will be emitted upon disconnecting
socket.on("disconnect", function() {
	
});

//This event will be emitted upon joining a room
socket.on("room.previousMessages", function(previousMessages) {
	//previousMessages is an array of previous messages in a room for a given trip
});

//This event will be emitted if another user joins a room
socket.on("room.userJoined", function(user) {
	//user.user_id, user.username, user.name are available
});

//This event will be emitted if the user leaves the current room
socket.on("room.left", function() {
	
});

//This event will be emitted if another user leaves the current room
socket.on("room.userLeft", function(user) {
	//user.user_id, user.username, user.name are available to be used
});

//This event will be emitted upon sending a message
socket.on("msg.sent", function(message) {
	//message has the full message structure, such as the msg_id
});

//This event will be emitted if a different user sends  amessage
socket.on("msg.new", function(message) {
	//message has the full message structure (see above)
});
```
